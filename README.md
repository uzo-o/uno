<br/>a 4-player text iteration of the card game Uno

## Description
This program allows the user to play games of Uno with 3 bots. 
Each player is distinguished with names entered by the user
and their own distinct color for text output. Note that the
'uno' and 'no uno' rules have been preserved (bots can type
"no uno" if the user doesn't type "uno" in time when they are
down to one card and vice versa).
